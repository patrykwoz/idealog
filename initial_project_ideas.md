# Capstone One Project Ideas

### Idea One (Simple): AEC Software Open DB - add, describe, tag, categorize and rate AEC software
1. Search, compare, add new software
2. Kind of like IMDB (movie database) for Architecture Engineering, Construction Software
3. No API sourcing - just building my own API
3. Display software database and analytics on it

### Idea Two (Preferred): App capturing,tracking research ideas, experiments, projects and use can build relationship between the objects (ideas, paper, experiments, sketches)
1. Start simple: Source Wikipedia API to create a list of “idea objects”
2. Develop a format for input and for sourcing(sourced API must be translated into that format)
3. UI for creating new ideas, upload sketches, pdfs with articles and research papers
4. Graph style interface where one can connect things together
5. Build database tracking these relationships and objects
6. Stretch goal: automated map of semantic relationships between ideas, projects, sketches, experiments, …
7. Inspiration: Automated Math Prover
8. Additional datasets of relevant “objects” (from papers, articles, etc.)
9. API Sourcing
10. *Crawler extracting relevant data from internet
    1. User can deploy their own crawlers
11. Build own API to serve structured data
12. User Story: user search >first served are ideas in the database (users own sketches, …) then ideas on wikipedia the ideas in relevant articles, ideas in relevant papers. results sorted based on relevance for example, tagged from which source (user’s own ideas or public repos etc)
13. For capstone 2: take this idea and develop it into spatial artifacts tracker - graph, geometry, data associated with the model of built environment

### Idea three (Simple): Continue working on G-Chomp
1. Source more data from discourse and Rhino API References
2. Organize, clean and filter data
3. Create my own API to serve structured data
4. Create UI to display data and stats, filter, search etc
5. Functionality to generate Grasshopper scripts from analyzed data
6. Stretch goal: use hugging face api/or open ai api to create semantic relationships between and facilitate generative ai/predictions

### Idea four (Hard): Using geocoding APIs create a layer of insights for a user specified location (e.g. the sunniest walking route to my grocer, etc.)
1. Use existing API to source data
2. Integrate map display into the app
3. Build your own API with construction focused data
4. Something similar to this: https://www.giraffe.build/ - it could maybe even integrate with it or this: https://hypar.io/
