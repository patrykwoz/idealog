# Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone di Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), and later known 
# by his regnal name Napoleon I, was a French military and political leader who rose to 
# prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the 
# Revolutionary Wars. He was the de facto leader of the French Republic as First Consul 
# from 1799 to 1804. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814 
# and again in 1815. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured, and he has 
# been one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in world history. Napoleon was 
# born on the island of Corsica not long after its annexation by the Kingdom of France.[5] 
# He supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French army, and tried to 
# spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the Army after he saved the 
# governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In 1796, he began a military 
# campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories and 
# becoming a national hero. Two years later, he led a military expedition to Egypt that 
# served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a coup in November 1799 and 
# became First Consul of the Republic. Differences with the British meant that the French 
# faced the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with 
# victories in the Ulm Campaign, and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolving 
# of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him because 
# Prussia became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon knocked 
# out Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the Grande Armée into Eastern 
# Europe, annihilating the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, and forcing the defeated 
# nations of the Fourth Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians 
# challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified 
# his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram. Hoping to extend the 
# Continental System, his embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula 
# and declared his brother Joseph King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese 
# revolted in the Peninsular War, culminating in defeat for Napoleon's marshals. Napoleon 
# launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed 
# the catastrophic retreat of Napoleon's Grande Armée. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined 
# Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France. A chaotic military campaign resulted in 
# a large coalition army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813. 
# The coalition invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. 
# He was exiled to the island of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. In France, the Bourbons were 
# restored to power. However, Napoleon escaped Elba in February 1815 and took control of France.[6][7] 
# The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of 
# Waterloo in June 1815. The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the 
# Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51. Napoleon had an extensive impact on the 
# modern world, bringing liberal reforms to the many countries he conquered, especially the 
# Low Countries, Switzerland, and parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented liberal 
# policies in France and Western Europe.
